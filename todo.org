- vertex_figure_t
- pure_complex_t
  an n-dimensional complex is said to be pure
  if each k cell (k < n) is a face of at least one n-dimensional cell
- by the boundary of a pure n-dimensional cell
  we mean the totality of (n - 1)-cell
  which are incident with an odd number n-cells
- bounfold_check
- continuous_map_check
  - check each id in dic -- from low dim to high dim
  - value of dic must be bounfold_t
  - image of id's cell's boundary can cover the bounfold_t exactly once
- product_complex_t
- quotient_complex_t -- self-gluing
- the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
  even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t
- simple generated geometry -- for polyhedron first
------
- a set of n >= 0 points is affinely independent
  if its affine hull has dimension n âˆ’ 1,
  that is, if every proper subset has a smaller affine hull.
