- homogeneous_chain_t check
- id_t -> homogeneous_chain_t
- cmap_t.dic -- dic_t <id_t, id_t> -> dic_t <id_t, homogeneous_chain_t>
- bounfold_t check
- cmap_t check
  - check each id in dic -- from low dim to high dim
  - closure of homogeneous_chain_t (a subcomplex) should be bounfold_t
  - image of id's cell's boundary can cover the bounfold_t exactly once
- generaic space_t
  for product_complex_t and quotient_complex_t
- generaic complex_t
  for both simplicial_complex_t and cell_complex_t
- product_complex_t
- quotient_complex_t -- self-gluing
- the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
  even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t
- simple generated geometry -- for polyhedron first
